# trafficLightRecognition

Features:

Various color classifiers:

1. gaussian color classifiers for segmenting colors

2. histogram backprojection for segmenting colors(colorSegmentation/backproject.cpp)

Falsecandidate reduction:

1. Basic BLOB analysis(blobAnalysis/blobAnalysis.cpp)

2. Finding shape(shapeSegmentation/edgeSegmentation.cpp)

3. Integrate stereo

  a. reject regions by looking at regionâ€™s cluster size and shape against the distance

  b. look at the volume around the candidate and determine if it looks right

4. tracking of found traffic signals

Light state classification:

1. Determine state using structural information

2. State machine

Tested on OSX, build using cmake 3.10. Compile instructions follows:

cmake .

make

./main <path to video clip>
